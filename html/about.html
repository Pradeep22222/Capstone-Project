                Brad is a Jack of all trades or should we say a Brad of all

                program events and Challenge Weekends. <br />
                Through the week you can see Brad delivering the CEP program and
                the independent living skills program. <br />
                When he isn’t working Brad is an incredibly sporty man. Not just
                any sport, Archery and Axe Throwing is his specialty! Brad
                competes regularly in Archery competitions and is on an Axe
                throwing team. If there was a Zombie apocalypse we would know
                who to call! <br />
                A highlight was when Kylie Monigue commented on one of Brads
                social media posts of the students in the CEP class dancing to
                the Locomotion!

                Since 2019, Sophie has loved volunteering with DSQ, embarking on
                many adventures with wonderful fun-loving people. Now acting as
                a Social Programs Coordinator, she is thrilled to be helping
                deliver fun and engaging programs that offer opportunities to
                develop independence, social skills and build confidence. Her
                highlight of being a part of the DSQ team has been attending
                Challenge Weekends, witnessing campers coming out of their
                shells and filling the weekend with joy, laughter, and hugs.
                <br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sophie loves jumping out of perfectly
                working planes, jet skiing, parasailing, snowboarding and plans
                to go wing walking. When she isn't trying to seriously injure
                herself, you'll catch her dragging her friends along to all
                sorts of random fun activities. But don't be fooled, by night
                she is a master couch potato, bingeing the latest must-see TV
